# group-leaderboards

`group-leaderboards` is a simple Django application that provides a leaderboard system for different groups: friends, teams, etc. You start by logging activities you've done, and then you can see how you rank against others in your group for various activity metrics. Have fun competing with your friends or colleagues!

## Features

- **Running activity logging**: log your running activities with details like distance, time, and pace, and other additional metrics.
- **Leaderboard**: see your activities sorted by various metrics such as distance, time, and pace.

### TODO

- Add filter to leaderboard which lets you see all metrics at once instead of single metric to get more context for activity performances
- Add ascending and descending sorting options for the leaderboard metrics: sort toggle buttons to column headers?
- Create an activity directly from the leaderboard
- Add group management features
- Add user profiles
- Add more activity types (cycling, swimming, etc.)
- Add tier lists
- Add animations for leaderboard updates
- Color themes to the user profiles
